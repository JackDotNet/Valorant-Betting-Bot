# Valorant-Betting-Bot

The idea for the this project came about when I watch a video on Bill Benter, a man who made millions betting on horses, I thought I could do something similar for the online game "Valorant". The project is unfinsished but has a working player scraper for hltv in order to get player data which can scrape every page and then make a JSON doc of every single players data. I also tested this with CSGO players since they are also on hltv and it wokred flawlessly. The project has gone unfinished because of the challeneg of working on coding projects and school simultaniously.

Looking back on this project, it's not even that bad, if someone finds use for any of these scripts more power to you because I can't even make sense of them any more lol.
